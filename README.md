# react-authorize-net
> ⚠️ This repo is obsolete, to see how to integrate the library with a modern react app, see this repo: https://github.com/j-em/react-authorize-net-nextjs

This repo contains an example of a React application (bootstrapped using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)) using the [react-authorize-net](https://github.com/j-em/react-authorize-net) library.

## How to run locally

```
npm run start
```

The application should then be reachable at http://localhost:8080
